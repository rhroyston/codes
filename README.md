HTML character codes intuitively ordered with optional auto copy to clipboard functionality.

These are select, commonly used HTML character codes.  The aim of this web application is usefulness and simplicity.

## Motivation

The sites I have found are too lengthy, list ubscure HTML character codes, and overall the codes are displayed in an unintuitive order.  I found myself wanting optional automatic copy to clipboard as well as a beautiful blond girl in the background.
