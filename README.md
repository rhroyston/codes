HTML character codes intuitively ordered with optional auto copy to clipboard functionality.

These are select, commonly used HTML character codes.  The aim of this web application is usefulness and simplicity.  

For an exhaustive list of HTML character codes, see [HTML5 Reference](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref).

## Motivation

The sites I have found are too lengthy, list ubscure HTML character codes, and overall the codes are displayed in an unintuitive order.  I found myself wanting automatic copy to clipboard upon clicking the character as well.
